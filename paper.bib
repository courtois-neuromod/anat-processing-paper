               has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of
               thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and
               diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive
               study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used
               to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no
               widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data
               collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and
               reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not
               impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of
               automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve
               this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure
               (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets.
               The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing
               software, unifies the majority of practices already common in
               the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common

              the development of several software packages for processing
              multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to study the
              brain. These software packages are now routinely used by
              researchers and clinicians, and have contributed to important
              breakthroughs for the understanding of brain anatomy and
              function. However, no software package exists to process mpMRI
              data of the spinal cord. Despite the numerous clinical needs for
              such advanced mpMRI protocols (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord
              injury, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, etc.), researchers have
              been developing specific tools that, while necessary, do not
              provide an integrative framework that is compatible with most
              usages and that is capable of reaching the community at large.
              This hinders cross-validation and the possibility to perform
              multi-center studies. In this study we introduce the Spinal Cord
              Toolbox (SCT), a comprehensive software dedicated to the
              processing of spinal cord MRI data. SCT builds on
              previously-validated methods and includes state-of-the-art MRI
              templates and atlases of the spinal cord, algorithms to segment
              and register new data to the templates, and motion correction
              methods for diffusion and functional time series. SCT is tailored
              towards standardization and automation of the processing
              pipeline, versatility, modularity, and it follows guidelines of
              software development and distribution. Preliminary applications
              of SCT cover a variety of studies, from cross-sectional area
              measures in large databases of patients, to the precise
              quantification of mpMRI metrics in specific spinal pathways. We
              anticipate that SCT will bring together the spinal cord

              acquired using quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) MRI in
              postmortem brains of subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS).
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: fB and T2B were acquired in unfixed
              postmortem brain slices of 20 subjects with MS. The myelin
              content, axonal count, and severity of gliosis were all
              quantified histologically. t-Tests and multiple regression were
              used for analysis. RESULTS: MR indices obtained in unfixed
              postmortem MS brains were consistent with in vivo values reported
              in the literature. A significant correlation was detected between
              Tr(myelin) (inversely proportional to myelin content) and 1) fB
              (r = -0.80, P < 0.001) and 2) axonal count (r = -0.79, P <
              0.001). fB differed between 1) normal-appearing white matter

              (mean: 4.2 [2.2] vs. 2.5 [1.3], P = 0.016). No association was
              detected between T2B and any of the histological measures.

              a tool to monitor patients with this condition.",

              reproducibility of quantitative values derived from a
              multidynamic multiecho (MDME) sequence for rapid simultaneous
              relaxometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The NIST/ISMRM (National
              Institute of Standards and Technology/International Society for
              Magnetic Resonance in Medicine) phantom, containing spheres with
              standardized T1 and T2 relaxation times and proton density (PD),
              and 10 healthy volunteers, were scanned 10 times on different
              days and 2 times during the same session, using the MDME
              sequence, on three 3 T scanners from different vendors. For
              healthy volunteers, brain volumetry and myelin estimation were
              performed based on the measured T1, T2, and PD. The measured
              phantom values were compared with reference values; volunteer
              values were compared with their averages across 3 scanners.
              RESULTS: The linearity of both phantom and volunteer measurements
              in T1, T2, and PD values was very strong (R = 0.973-1.000,
              0.979-1.000, and 0.982-0.999, respectively) The highest
              intrascanner coefficients of variation (CVs) for T1, T2, and PD
              were 2.07\%, 7.60\%, and 12.86\% for phantom data, and 1.33\%,
              0.89\%, and 0.77\% for volunteer data, respectively. The highest
              interscanner CVs of T1, T2, and PD were 10.86\%, 15.27\%, and
              9.95\% for phantom data, and 3.15\%, 5.76\%, and 3.21\% for
              volunteer data, respectively. Variation of T1 and T2 tended to be
              larger at higher values outside the range of those typically
              observed in brain tissue. The highest intrascanner and
              interscanner CVs for brain tissue volumetry were 2.50\% and
              5.74\%, respectively, for cerebrospinal fluid. CONCLUSIONS:
              Quantitative values derived from the MDME sequence are overall
              robust for brain relaxometry and volumetry on 3 T scanners from
              different vendors. Caution is warranted when applying MDME

              fabricated to assess scanner performance, stability,
              comparability and assess the accuracy of quantitative relaxation
              time imaging. The phantom is unique in having traceability to the
              International System of Units, a high level of precision, and
              monitoring by a national metrology institute. Here, we describe
              the phantom design, construction, imaging protocols, and
              measurement of geometric distortion, resolution, slice profile,
              signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), proton-spin relaxation times, image
              uniformity and proton density. METHODS: The system phantom,
              designed by the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in
              Medicine ad hoc committee on Standards for Quantitative MR, is a
              200 mm spherical structure that contains a 57-element fiducial
              array; two relaxation time arrays; a proton density/SNR array;
              resolution and slice-profile insets. Standard imaging protocols
              are presented, which provide rapid assessment of geometric
              distortion, image uniformity, T1 and T2 mapping, image
              resolution, slice profile, and SNR. RESULTS: Fiducial array
              analysis gives assessment of intrinsic geometric distortions,
              which can vary considerably between scanners and correction
              techniques. This analysis also measures scanner/coil image
              uniformity, spatial calibration accuracy, and local volume
              distortion. An advanced resolution analysis gives both scanner
              and protocol contributions. SNR analysis gives both temporal and
              spatial contributions. CONCLUSIONS: A standard system phantom is
              useful for characterization of scanner performance, monitoring a
              scanner over time, and to compare different scanners. This type
              of calibration structure is useful for quality assurance,
              benchmarking quantitative MRI protocols, and to transition MRI

               them validated in phantoms and reporting excellent agreement
               with literature. However, values in literature vary greatly,
               with T1 in white matter ranging from 690 to 1100 ms at 3 Tesla.
               This brings into question the accuracy of one of the most
               fundamental measurements in quantitative MRI. Our goal was to
               explain these variations and look into ways of mitigating them.
               Theory and Methods We evaluated the three most common T1 mapping
               methods (inversion recovery, Look-Locker, and variable flip
               angle) through Bloch simulations, a white matter phantom and the
               brains of 10 healthy subjects (single-slice). We pooled the T1
               histograms of the subjects to determine whether there is a
               sequence-dependent bias and whether it is reproducible across
               subjects. Results We found good agreement between the three
               methods in phantoms, but poor agreement in vivo, with the white
               matter T1 histogram peak in healthy subjects varying by more
               than 30\% depending on the method used. We also found that the
               pooled brain histograms displayed three distinct white matter
               peaks, with Look-Locker consistently underestimating, and
               variable flip angle overestimating the inversion recovery T1
               values. The Bloch simulations indicated that incomplete spoiling
               and inaccurate B1 mapping could account for the observed
               differences. Conclusion We conclude that the three most common
               T1 mapping protocols produce stable T1 values in phantoms, but
               not in vivo. To improve the accuracy of T1 mapping, we recommend
               that sites perform in vivo validation of their T1 mapping method
               against the inversion recovery reference method, as the first

  abstract  = "Purpose To determine the contribution of paramagnetic dissolved
               oxygen in blood plasma to blood-oxygenation-level-dependent
               (BOLD) signal changes in hyperoxic calibrated BOLD studies.
               Methods Bovine blood plasma samples were prepared with partial
               pressures of oxygen (pO2) ranging from 110 to 600 mmHg. R1, R2,
               and R2* of the plasma with dissolved oxygen were measured using
               quantitative MRI sequences at 3 Tesla. Simulations were
               performed to predict the relative effects of dissolved oxygen
               and deoxyhemoglobin changes in hyperoxia calibrated BOLD.
               Results The relaxivities of dissolved oxygen in plasma were
               found to be r1, O2 =1.97 $\pm$ 0.09 ?10-4 s-1mmHg-1, r2, O2 =2.3
               $\pm$ 0.7 ?10-4 s-1mmHg-1, and r2, O2* = 2.3 $\pm$ 0.7 ?10-4
               s-1mmHg-1. Simulations predict that neither the transverse nor
               longitudinal relaxation rates of dissolved oxygen contribute
               significantly to the BOLD signal during hyperoxia. Conclusion
               During hyperoxia, the increases in R2 and R2* of blood from
               dissolved oxygen in plasma are considerably less than the
               decreases in R2 and R2* from venous deoxyhemoglobin. R1 effects
               due to dissolved oxygen are also predicted to be negligible. As

  abstract = "Spinal cord atrophy is a well-known biomarker in multiple
              sclerosis (MS) and other diseases. It is measured by segmenting
              the spinal cord on an MRI image and computing the average
              cross-sectional area (CSA) over a few slices. Introduced about 25
              years ago, this procedure is highly sensitive to the quality of
              the segmentation and is prone to rater-bias. Recently,
              fully-automated spinal cord segmentation methods, which remove
              the rater-bias and enable the automated analysis of large
              populations, have been introduced. A lingering question related
              to these automated methods is: How reliable are they at detecting
              atrophy? In this study, we evaluated the precision and accuracy
              of automated atrophy measurements by simulating scan-rescan
              experiments. Spinal cord MRI data from the open-access
              spine-generic project were used. The dataset aggregates 42 sites
              worldwide and consists of 260 healthy subjects and includes T1w
              and T2w contrasts. To simulate atrophy, each volume was globally
              rescaled at various scaling factors. Moreover, to simulate
              patient repositioning, random rigid transformations were applied.
              Using the DeepSeg algorithm from the Spinal Cord Toolbox, the
              spinal cord was segmented and vertebral levels were identified.
              Then, the average CSA between C3-C5 vertebral levels was computed
              for each Monte Carlo sample, allowing us to derive measures of
              atrophy, intra/inter-subject variability, and sample-size
              calculations. The minimum sample size required to detect an
              atrophy of 2\% between unpaired study arms, commonly seen in MS
              studies, was 467 +/- 13.9 using T1w and 467 +/- 3.2 using T2w
              images. The minimum sample size to detect a longitudinal atrophy
              (between paired study arms) of 0.8\% was 60 +/- 25.1 using T1w
              and 10 +/- 1.2 using T2w images. At the intra-subject level, the
              estimated CSA, observed in this study, showed good precision
              compared to other studies with COVs (across Monte Carlo
              transformations) of 0.8\% for T1w and 0.6\% for T2w images. While
              these sample sizes seem small, we would like to stress that these
              results correspond to a ``best case'' scenario, in that the
              dataset used here was of particularly good quality and the model
              for simulating atrophy does not encompass all the variability met
              in real-life datasets. The simulated atrophy and scan-rescan
              variability may over-simplify the biological reality. The
              proposed framework is open-source and available at

              measurements, using a slow, reference standard inversion recovery
              sequence and a rapid, commonly-available variable flip angle
              sequence, across MRI systems at 1.5 tesla (T) (two vendors, with
              number of MRI systems n = 9) and 3 T (three vendors, n = 18). We
              compared the T1 measurements from inversion recovery and variable
              flip angle scans to ISMRM/NIST phantom reference values using
              Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to test for statistical differences
              between T1 measurements grouped according to MRI scanner
              manufacturers and/or static field strengths. The inversion
              recovery method had minor over- and under-estimations compared to
              the NMR-measured T1 values at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Variable flip

              for increased statistical power and generalizable results.
              However, multisite collaborative initiatives are inherently

              in-vivo neuroimaging biomarkers of diverse neurological and

              toward increasing the diagnostic and prognostic power of advanced
              MRI data. To this aim, 23 Italian Scientific Institutes of
              Hospitalization and Care (IRCCS), with technological and clinical
              specialization in the neurological and neuroimaging field, have
              gathered together. Each IRCCS is equipped with high- or
              ultra-high field MRI scanners (i.e., $\geq$3T) for clinical or
              preclinical research or has established expertise in MRI data
              analysis and infrastructure. The actions of this Network were
              defined across several work packages (WP). A clinical work
              package (WP1) defined the guidelines for a minimum standard
              clinical qualitative MRI assessment for the main neurological
              diseases. Two neuroimaging technical work packages (WP2 and WP3,
              for clinical and preclinical scanners) established Standard

              advanced harmonized quantitative MRI protocols for studying the
              brain of healthy human participants and wild type mice. Under
              FAIR principles, a web-based e-infrastructure to store and share
              data across sites was also implemented (WP4). Finally, the RIN

              g-ratio, may provide more specific markers of white matter
              integrity than conventional MRI for early patient stratification
              in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The aim of this
              study is to determine the sensitivity of such markers to
              longitudinal pathological change within cerebral white matter
              lesions (WML) and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in
              recently diagnosed RRMS. Methods Seventy-nine people with
              recently diagnosed RRMS, from the FutureMS longitudinal cohort,
              were recruited to an extended MRI protocol at baseline and one
              year later. Twelve healthy volunteers received the same MRI
              protocol, repeated within two weeks. Ethics approval and written
              informed consent were obtained. 3T MRI included magnetisation
              transfer, and multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging. NAWM and
              whole brain volume (WBV) were segmented from 3D T1-weighted
              MPRAGE, and WML from T2-weighted FLAIR. MTR, MTsat, NODDI
              isotropic (ISOVF) and intracellular (ICVF) volume fractions, and
              aggregate g-ratio were measured within WML and NAWM. G-ratio was
              calculated from MTsat and NODDI data. Longitudinal change in
              brain volume and microstructural metrics was assessed with paired
              t-tests ($\alpha$=0.05) and linear mixed models, corrected for
              confounding factors and multiple comparisons. Longitudinal
              changes were compared with test-retest Bland-Altman limits of
              agreement from healthy volunteer control white matter. The
              influence of varying MTsat and NODDI parameters on derived
              g-ratio was explored in silico . Results In NAWM, paired t-tests
              show a significant increase in g-ratio (p=0.012) and ICVF
              (p=0.025), and a decrease in MTsat (p=0.033) over one year, but

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) is
              a sensitive and quantitative identifier of underlying structural
              changes in the brain. We quantitatively evaluated age- and
              sex-related MTR changes in global gray matter (GM) and global
              white matter (WM) in healthy adults. METHODS: Fifty-two healthy
              volunteers (21 men, 31 women) aged 20-86 years underwent
              dual-echo fast spin-echo and magnetization transfer imaging
              performed with and then without a saturation pulse. GM and WM
              were distinguished by using a computer-assisted semiautomated
              segmentation technique. MTR histograms were generated for each
              segmented tissue in each subject and compared among age and sex
              groups. RESULTS: The mean, median, first quartile, and peak
              height of the MTR histogram were significantly lower in the older
              group (> or =50 years) than those in the younger group (<50
              years) for both GM and WM. The age dependency of these values can
              be expressed in a quadratic fashion over the entire span of
              adulthood. The MTRs started to decline only after the age of
              approximately 40 years in both tissues. No statistically
              significant differences in MTR histogram measurements between the
              sexes were observed. CONCLUSION: The different MTR values for
              both GM and WM in the two age groups suggest that notable
              microscopic changes occur in GM and WM with advancing age, yet no
              significant sex-related variations in MTR measurements were found
              in these neurologically healthy adults. Such normative data based
              on the inherent contrast in MTRs are essential in studies of
              specific disorders of aging, and they may have implications for
              our understanding of the gross structural changes in both GM and
              WM in the aging brain.",

              hypointense blooming artifacts to precise quantitative
              measurement of spatial biodistributions. QSM technology may be
              regarded to be sufficiently developed and validated to warrant
              wide dissemination for clinical applications of imaging isotropic
              susceptibility, which is dominated by metals in tissue, including
              iron and calcium. These biometals are highly regulated as vital
              participants in normal cellular biochemistry, and their
              dysregulations are manifested in a variety of pathologic
              processes. Therefore, QSM can be used to assess important tissue
              functions and disease. To facilitate QSM clinical translation,
              this review aims to organize pertinent information for
              implementing a robust automated QSM technique in routine MRI
              practice and to summarize available knowledge on diseases for
              which QSM can be used to improve patient care. In brief, QSM can
              be generated with postprocessing whenever gradient echo MRI is
              performed. QSM can be useful for diseases that involve
              neurodegeneration, inflammation, hemorrhage, abnormal oxygen
              consumption, substantial alterations in highly paramagnetic
              cellular iron, bone mineralization, or pathologic calcification;
              and for all disorders in which MRI diagnosis or surveillance
              requires contrast agent injection. Clinicians may consider

              to assess iron deposition in the liver and heart and to guide

              inter-observer variations in T2* measurements of the myocardium
              and the liver, and to obtain the lower limit of cardiac and
              hepatic quantitative T2* values in patients without suspicion of
              iron overload. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients
              referred for cardiac MRI were prospectively included in the
              study. Three patients were referred with, and 35 without
              suspicion of iron overload. Quantitative T2* parametric maps were
              obtained on a 1.5 T MRI system in the cardiac short axis and
              liver axial view. Two readers independently assessed the image
              quality and the representative and the lowest T2* value in the

              representative T2* values in the myocardium and liver was 24-45

              B0-distortion-corrected and transformed to the ICBM-152 atlas or

              have been previously well documented and clearly identified by
              DTI, were manually segmented. The superficial white matter areas
              beneath the cortex were defined, based on a population-averaged
              white matter probability map. The white matter was parcellated
              into 176 regions based on the anatomical labeling in the

              measurement errors. By independently mapping the local B(1)(+)
              variation, the radiofrequency-related signal variations can be
              corrected for. In this study, we present a new fast B(1)(+)
              mapping method using a slice-selective preconditioning
              radiofrequency pulse. Immediately after applying a
              slice-selective preconditioning pulse, a turbo fast
              low-angle-shot imaging sequence with centric k-space reordering
              is performed to capture the residual longitudinal magnetization
              left behind by the slice-selective preconditioning pulse due to
              B(1)(+) variation. Compared to the reference double-angle method,
              this method is considerably faster. Specifically, the total scan
              time for the double-angle method is equal to the product of 2
              (number of images), the number of phase-encoding lines, and

              an automated labeling system that we have developed for
              subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance
              images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a
              dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs
              in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then
              encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to
              automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the
              intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we
              used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new
              method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of
              mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When
              compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly
              accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs,
              and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and
              inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between
              the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated
              method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral
              cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both
              anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for
              both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex
              as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the
              evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including
              clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine
              response to treatment.",

  abstract = "Introduction Quantitative microstructural MRI, such as
              myelin-sensitive magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) or saturation
              (MTsat), axon-sensitive water diffusion Neurite Orientation
              Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), and the aggregate
              g-ratio, may provide more specific markers of white matter
              integrity than conventional MRI for early patient stratification
              in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The aim of this
              study was to determine the sensitivity of such markers to
              longitudinal pathological change within cerebral white matter
              lesions (WML) and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in
              recently diagnosed RRMS. Methods Seventy-nine people with
              recently diagnosed RRMS, from the FutureMS longitudinal cohort,
              were recruited to an extended MRI protocol at baseline and one
              year later. Twelve healthy volunteers received the same MRI
              protocol, repeated within two weeks. Ethics approval and written
              informed consent were obtained. 3T MRI included magnetisation
              transfer, and multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging. NAWM and
              whole brain were segmented from 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE, and WML
              from T2-weighted FLAIR. MTR, MTsat, NODDI isotropic (ISOVF) and
              intracellular (ICVF) volume fractions, and g-ratio (calculated
              from MTsat and NODDI data) were measured within WML and NAWM.
              Brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) was also calculated.
              Longitudinal change in BPF and microstructural metrics was
              assessed with paired t-tests ($\alpha$ = 0.05) and linear mixed
              models, adjusted for confounding factors with False Discovery
              Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons. Longitudinal
              changes were compared with test-retest Bland-Altman limits of
              agreement from healthy control white matter. The influence of
              longitudinal change on g-ratio was explored through post-hoc
              analysis in silico by computing g-ratio with realistic simulated
              MTsat and NODDI values. Results In NAWM, g-ratio and ICVF
              increased, and MTsat decreased over one year (adjusted mean
              difference = 0.007, 0.005, and −0.057 respectively, all
              FDR-corrected p < 0.05). There was no significant change in MTR,
              ISOVF, or BPF. In WML, MTsat, NODDI ICVF and ISOVF increased over
              time (adjusted mean difference = 0.083, 0.024 and 0.016,
              respectively, all FDR-corrected p < 0.05). Group-level
              longitudinal changes exceeded test-retest limits of agreement for
              NODDI ISOVF and ICVF in WML only. In silico analysis showed
              g-ratio may increase due to a decrease in MTsat or ISOVF, or an
              increase in ICVF. Discussion G-ratio and MTsat changes in NAWM
              over one year may indicate subtle myelin loss in early RRMS,
              which were not apparent with BPF or NAWM MTR. Increases in NAWM
              and WML NODDI ICVF were not anticipated, and raise the
              possibility of axonal swelling or morphological change. Increases
              in WML MTsat may reflect myelin repair. Changes in NODDI ISOVF
              are more likely to reflect alterations in water content.
              Competing MTsat and ICVF changes may account for the absence of
              g-ratio change in WML. Longitudinal changes in microstructural
              measures are significant at a group level, however detection in
              individual patients in early RRMS is limited by technique
              reproducibility. Conclusion MTsat and g-ratio are more sensitive
              than MTR to early pathological changes in RRMS, but complex
              dependence of g-ratio on NODDI parameters limit the
              interpretation of aggregate measures in isolation. Improvements
              in technique reproducibility and validation of MRI biophysical
              models across a range of pathological tissue states are needed.",

              mechanisms of aging, and the consequences of aging in terms of
              cognition and onset of disease. Morphological changes with aging
              are reviewed for the whole brain, cerebral cortex, white matter,
              subcortical gray matter, and other individual structures. In
              general, volume and cortical thickness decline with age,
              beginning in mid-life. Prevalent silent lesions such as white
              matter hyperintensities, microbleeds, and lacunar infarcts are
              also observed with increasing frequency. The literature regarding

              a limited set of the properties that can in principle be accessed

              acquisition, post-processing and visualization--which we term
              'magnetic resonance fingerprinting' (MRF)--that permits the
              simultaneous non-invasive quantification of multiple important
              properties of a material or tissue. MRF thus provides an
              alternative way to quantitatively detect and analyse complex
              changes that can represent physical alterations of a substance or
              early indicators of disease. MRF can also be used to identify the
              presence of a specific target material or tissue, which will
              increase the sensitivity, specificity and speed of a magnetic

              dissected 50 white matter (WM) fascicles. These fascicles connect
              deep nuclei (thalamus, putamen, pallidum) to different cortical
              functional areas (associative, motor, sensorimotor, limbic),
              basal forebrain and substantia nigra. Then, among these 50
              candidate WM fascicles, only the ones that passed a test-retest
              reproducibility procedure qualified for further tractometry
              analysis. Leveraging the unique 2-timepoints test-retest
              Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset of over

              as T2, T2* and T2' mapping at 3 Tesla. Cortical reconstruction
              was performed with the FreeSurfer toolbox, followed by tests for
              correlations between qMRI parameters and age. Cortical T1 values
              were negatively correlated with age (p=0.007) and there was a
              widespread age-related decrease of cortical T1 involving the
              frontal and the parietotemporal cortex, while T2 was correlated
              positively with age, both in frontoparietal areas and globally
              (p=0.004). Cortical T2' values showed the most widespread
              associations across the cortex and strongest correlation with age
              (r= -0.724, p=0.0001). PD and T2* did not correlate with age.
              Multiparametric qMRI allows to characterize cortical aging,
              unveiling parameter-specific patterns. Quantitative T2' mapping
              seems to be a promising imaging biomarker of cortical age-related

              in the human spinal cord: T1, Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR),
              saturation imposed by an off-resonance pulse (MTsat) and
              Macromolecular Tissue Volume (MTV). METHODS: Thirty-three healthy
              subjects within two age groups (young, elderly) were scanned at
              3T. Among them, 16 underwent the protocol twice to assess
              repeatability. Statistical reliability indexes such as the
              Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were compared across metrics
              quantified within different cervical levels and white matter (WM)
              sub-regions. The differences between pathways and age groups were
              quantified and interpreted in context of the test-retest
              repeatability of the measurements. RESULTS: The MDC was
              respectively 105.7ms, 2.77\%, 0.37\% and 4.08\% for T1, MTR,
              MTsat and MTV when quantified over all WM, while the
              standard-deviation across subjects was 70.5ms, 1.34\%, 0.20\% and
              2.44\%. Even though particular WM regions did exhibit significant
              differences, these differences were on the same order as
              test-retest errors. No significant difference was found between
              age groups for all metrics. CONCLUSION: While T1-based metrics
              (T1 and MTV) exhibited better reliability than MT-based
              measurements (MTR and MTsat), the observed differences between
              subjects or WM regions were comparable to (and often smaller
              than) the MDC. This makes it difficult to determine if observed
              changes are due to variations in myelin content, or simply due to
              measurement error. Measurement error remains a challenge in
              spinal cord myelin imaging, but this study provides statistical
              guidelines to standardize the field and make it possible to
              conduct large-scale multi-center studies.",

  abstract = "AIM: An approach to measuring physical quantities such as lesion
              load with MRI in multicentre studies is presented. METHOD:
              Examples are given of imperfections in current techniques: (1) a
              step change in a serial trial, giving an apparent (but
              artefactual) decrease in total lesion volume in untreated
              patients with multiple sclerosis; (2) inaccuracy (systematic
              error) in lesion volume, found by measuring a phantom with
              lesions of known volumes; (3) spatial non-uniformity in the
              radiofrequency coil sensitivity, giving gross image shading. When
              using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner as a
              scientific instrument to measure physical quantities, accuracy
              (closeness to the truth, or lack of systematic error), and
              precision (reproducibility, or lack of random error) are the keys
              to success. Quality assurance procedures can utilise phantoms,
              normal control subjects, and stable patients, and have to be
              included in serial studies and trials. Between scanner agreement
              can perhaps be improved by attempting to replicate an inaccurate
              procedure at each site; but it is more preferable to seek
              accuracy and precision (as a perfectly accurate and precise
              procedure must give the same results at all sites). CONCLUSION:
              Before being included in a serial study, a measurement procedure
              should ideally demonstrate:(1) accuracy in a phantom; (2)
              precision in repeated measurements on a phantom; (3) precision in

              diseases scanned with a multidynamic multiecho sequence for
              simultaneous measurement of relaxometry of T1, T2, and PD. We
              performed myelin estimation and brain volumetry based on these

              matter (GM) and white matter (WM) regions for T1, T2, PD, and
              myelin volume fraction maps. Tissue volumes were calculated in

              intracranial volume to a brain parenchymal fraction, GM fraction,

              in the mean regional quantitative values and segmented tissue
              volumes according to age. Results We analyzed data of 114 adults

              to age and stayed stable or decreased until around 60 years of
              age and increased thereafter. Myelin volume fraction showed a
              reversed trend. Brain parenchymal fraction and GM fraction
              decreased throughout all ages. The approximation curves showed

              on functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets and
              lacked guidance on how to store multimodal structural MRI
              datasets. Here, we present and describe the BIDS Extension
              Proposal 001 (BEP001), which adds a range of quantitative MRI
              (qMRI) applications to the BIDS. In general, the aim of qMRI is
              to characterize brain microstructure by quantifying the physical
              MR parameters of the tissue via computational, biophysical
              models. By proposing this new standard, we envision
              standardization of qMRI through multicenter dissemination of
              interoperable datasets. This way, BIDS can act as a catalyst of
              convergence between qMRI methods development and
              application-driven neuroimaging studies that can help develop

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: T1 relaxometry is a promising tool for the assessment
              of microstructural changes during brain ageing. Previous
              cross-sectional studies demonstrated increasing T1 values in
              white and decreasing T1 values in grey matter over the lifetime.
              However, these findings have not yet been confirmed on the basis
              of a longitudinal study. In this longitudinal study over 7 years,
              T1 relaxometry was used to investigate the dynamics of
              age-related microstructural changes in older healthy subjects.
              METHODS: T1 mapping was performed in 17 healthy subjects (range
              51-77 years) at baseline and after 7 years. Advanced cortical and
              white matter segmentation was used to determine mean T1 values in
              the cortex and white matter. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a
              decrease of mean cortical T1 values over 7 years, the rate of T1
              reduction being more prominent in subjects with higher age. T1
              decreases were predominantly localized in the lateral frontal,
              parietal and temporal cortex. In contrast, mean white matter T1
              values remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: T1 mapping is shown to be
              sensitive to age-related microstructural changes in healthy
              ageing subjects in a longitudinal setting. Data of a cohort in
              late adulthood and the senescence period demonstrate a decrease
              of cortical T1 values over 7 years, most likely reflecting
              decreasing water content and increased iron concentrations. KEY
              POINTS: • T1 mapping is sensitive to age-related microstructural
              changes in a longitudinal setting. • T1 decreases were
              predominantly localized in the lateral frontal, parietal and
              temporal cortex. • The rate of T1 reduction was more prominent in

               Physical Measurement gives a unique view on how to use an MRI
               machine in a new way. Used as a scientific instrument it can
               make measurements of a myriad of physical and biological
               quantities in the human brain and body. For each small tissue
               voxel, non-invasive information monitors how tissue changes with
               disease and responds to treatment. The book opens with a
               detailed exposition of the principles of good practice in
               quantification, including fundamental concepts, quality
               assurance, MR data collection and analysis and improved study
               statistical power through minimised instrumental variation.
               There follow chapters on 14 specific groups of quantities:
               proton density, T1, T2, T2*, diffusion, advanced diffusion,
               magnetisation transfer, CEST, 1H and multi-nuclear spectroscopy,
               DCE-MRI, quantitative fMRI, arterial spin-labelling and image
               analysis, and finally a chapter on the future of quantification.
               The physical principles behind each quantity are stated,
               followed by its biological significance. Practical techniques
               for measurement are given, along with pitfalls and examples of
               clinical applications. This second edition of this indispensable
               'how to' manual of quantitative MR shows the MRI physicist and
               research clinician how to implement these techniques on an MRI
               scanner to understand more about the biological processes in the
               patient and physiological changes in healthy controls. Although
               focussed on the brain, most techniques are applicable to
               characterising tissue in the whole body. This book is essential

               quantitative MRI methods to measure the effects of disease, its

              and reproducible way of extracting relevant information from
              multi-parametric MRI data. Using common atlases, it is possible
              to quantify MRI metrics within specific regions without the need
              for manual segmentation. This method is therefore free from
              user-bias and amenable to group studies. While template-based
              analysis is common procedure for the brain, there is currently no
              atlas of the white matter (WM) spinal pathways. The goals of this
              study were: (i) to create an atlas of the white matter tracts
              compatible with the MNI-Poly-AMU template and (ii) to propose
              methods to quantify metrics within the atlas that account for
              partial volume effect. The WM atlas was generated by: (i)
              digitalizing an existing WM atlas from a well-known source
              (Gray's Anatomy), (ii) registering this atlas to the MNI-Poly-AMU
              template at the corresponding slice (C4 vertebral level), (iii)
              propagating the atlas throughout all slices of the template (C1
              to T6) using regularized diffeomorphic transformations and (iv)
              computing partial volume values for each voxel and each tract.
              Several approaches were implemented and validated to quantify
              metrics within the atlas, including weighted-average and Gaussian
              mixture models. Proof-of-concept application was done in five
              subjects for quantifying magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) in
              each tract of the atlas. The resulting WM atlas showed consistent
              topological organization and smooth transitions along the
              rostro-caudal axis. The median MTR across tracts was 26.2.
              Significant differences were detected across tracts, vertebral
              levels and subjects, but not across laterality (right-left).
              Among the different tested approaches to extract metrics, the
              maximum a posteriori showed highest performance with respect to
              noise, inter-tract variability, tract size and partial volume
              effect. This new WM atlas of the human spinal cord overcomes the
              biases associated with manual delineation and partial volume
              effect. Combined with multi-parametric data, the atlas can be
              applied to study demyelination and degeneration in diseases such
              as multiple sclerosis and will facilitate the conduction of
              longitudinal and multi-center studies.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: To determine whether differences in hydration state,
              which could arise from routine clinical procedures such as
              overnight fasting, affect brain total water content (TWC) and
              brain volume measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned
              with a 3T MR scanner four times: day 1, baseline scan; day 2,
              hydrated scan after consuming 3L of water over 12 hours; day 3,
              dehydrated scan after overnight fasting of 9 hours, followed by
              another scan 1 hour later for reproducibility. The following MRI
              data were collected: T2 relaxation (for TWC measurement),
              inversion recovery (for T1 measurement), and 3D T1 -weighted (for
              brain volumes). Body weight and urine specific gravity were also
              measured. TWC was calculated by fitting the T2 relaxation data
              with a nonnegative least-squares algorithm, with corrections for
              T1 relaxation and image signal inhomogeneity and normalization to
              ventricular cerebrospinal fluid. Brain volume changes were
              measured using SIENA. TWC means were calculated within 14 tissue
              regions. RESULTS: Despite indications of dehydration as
              demonstrated by increases in urine specific gravity (P = 0.03)
              and decreases in body weight (P = 0.001) between hydrated and
              dehydrated scans, there was no measurable change in TWC (within
              any brain region) or brain volume between hydration states.
              CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that within a range of physiologic
              conditions commonly encountered in routine clinical scans (no
              pretreatment with hydration, well hydrated before MRI, and
              overnight fasting), brain TWC and brain volumes are not
              substantially affected in a healthy control cohort. J. Magn.

              reliability over time and across subjects and sites. However,
              long acquisition times (20 min for the standard 1-mm isotropic
              protocol) limit its translational potential. This study aimed to
              evaluate the sensitivity gain of a fast 1.6-mm isotropic MPM
              protocol including post-processing optimized for longitudinal
              clinical studies. 6 healthy volunteers (35$\pm$7 years old; 3
              female) were scanned at 3T to acquire the following whole-brain
              MPM maps with 1.6 mm isotropic resolution: proton density (PD),
              magnetization transfer saturation (MT), longitudinal relaxation
              rate (R1), and transverse relaxation rate (R2*). MPM maps were
              generated using two RF transmit field (B1+) correction methods:
              (1) using an acquired B1+ map and (2) using a data-driven
              approach. Maps were generated with and without Gibb's ringing
              correction. The intra-/inter-subject coefficient of variation
              (CoV) of all maps in the gray and white matter, as well as in all
              anatomical regions of a fine-grained brain atlas, were compared
              between the different post-processing methods using Student's
              t-test. The intra-subject stability of the 1.6-mm MPM protocol is
              2-3 times higher than for the standard 1-mm sequence and can be
              achieved in less than half the scan duration. Intra-subject
              variability for all four maps in white matter ranged from
              1.2-5.3\% and in gray matter from 1.8 to 9.2\%. Bias-field
              correction using an acquired B1+ map significantly improved
              intra-subject variability of PD and R1 in the gray (42\%) and
              white matter (54\%) and correcting the raw images for the effect
              of Gibb's ringing further improved intra-subject variability in
              all maps in the gray (11\%) and white matter (10\%). Combining
              Gibb's ringing correction and bias field correction using
              acquired B1+ maps provides excellent stability of the 7-min MPM

              We compare R1 with cortical thickness, a well-established
              biomarker of brain development and aging. Using 160 healthy
              individuals (6-81 years old), we found that R1 and cortical
              thickness predicted age similarly, but the regions contributing
              to the prediction differed. Next, we characterized R1 development
              and aging dynamics. Compared with anterior regions, in posterior
              regions we found an earlier R1 peak but a steeper postpeak

              longitudinal changes in quantitative spinal cord magnetic
              resonance imaging (SC-MRI). OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was
              to characterize the relationships between 5-year changes in
              SC-MRI with disability in MS. METHODS: In total, 75 MS patients
              underwent 3 T SC-MRI and clinical assessment (expanded disability
              status scale (EDSS) and MS functional composite (MSFC)) at
              baseline, 2 and 5 years. SC-cross-sectional area (CSA) and
              diffusion-tensor indices (fractional anisotropy (FA), mean,
              perpendicular, parallel diffusivity (MD, $\lambda$$\bot$,
              $\lambda$||) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR)) were
              extracted at C3-C4. Mixed-effects regression incorporating
              subject-specific slopes assessed longitudinal change in SC-MRI
              measures. RESULTS: SC-CSA and MTR decreased (p = 0.009, p = 0.03)
              over 5.1 years. There were moderate correlations between 2- and
              5-year subject-specific slopes of SC-MRI indices and follow-up
              EDSS scores (Pearson's r with FA = -0.23 (p < 0.001); MD = 0.31
              (p < 0.001); $\lambda$$\bot$ = 0.34 (p < 0.001); $\lambda$|| =
              -0.12 (p = 0.05), MTR = -0.37 (p < 0.001); SC-CSA = -0.47 (p <
              0.001) at 5 years); MSFC showed similar trends. The 2- and 5-year
              subject-specific slopes were robustly correlated (r = 0.93-0.97
              for FA, $\lambda$$\bot$, SC-CSA and MTR, all ps < 0.001).
              CONCLUSION: In MS, certain quantitative SC-MRI indices change
              over 5 years, reflecting ongoing tissue changes. Subject-specific
              trajectories of SC-MRI index change at 2 and 5 years are strongly
              correlated and highly relevant to follow-up disability. These
              findings suggest that individual dynamics of change should be
              accounted for when interpreting longitudinal SC-MRI measures and
              that measuring short-term change is predictive of long-term

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Parametric imaging methods (e.g., T1 relaxation time
              mapping) have been shown to be more reproducible across time and
              vendors than weighted (e.g., T1 -weighted) images. The purpose of
              this work was to more extensively evaluate the validity of this
              assertion. METHODS: Seven volunteers underwent twice-repeated
              acquisitions of variable flip-angle T1 mapping, including B1 +
              calibration, on a 3T Philips Achieva and 3T Siemens Trio scanner.
              Intra-scanner and inter-vendor T1 variability were calculated. To
              determine T1 reproducibility levels in longitudinal settings, or
              after changing hardware or software, four additional data sets
              were acquired from two of the participants; one participant was
              scanned on a different 3T Siemens Trio scanner and another on the
              same 3T Philips Achieva scanner but after a software upgrade.
              RESULTS: Intra-scanner variability of voxel-wise T1 values was
              consistent between the two vendors, averaging 0.7/0.7/1.3/1.4\%
              in white matter/cortical gray matter/subcortical gray
              matter/cerebellum, respectively. We observed, however, a
              systematic bias between the two vendors of
              https://doi.org/10.0/7.8/8.6/10.0\%, respectively. The T1 bias
              across two scanners of the same model was greater than
              intra-scanner variability, although still only at
              1.4/1.0/1.9/2.3\%, respectively. A greater bias was identified
              for data sets acquired before/after software upgrade in white
              matter/cortical gray matter (3.6/2.7\%) whereas variability in
              subcortical gray matter/cerebellum was comparable (1.7/1.9\%).
              CONCLUSION: We established intra- and inter-vendor
              reproducibility levels for a widely used T1 mapping protocol. We
              anticipate that these results will guide the design of
              multi-center studies, particularly those encompassing multiple
              vendors. Furthermore, this baseline level of reproducibility
              should be established or surpassed during the piloting phase of
              such studies.",

  abstract = "The spinal cord is frequently affected by atrophy and/or lesions
              in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Segmentation of the spinal
              cord and lesions from MRI data provides measures of damage, which
              are key criteria for the diagnosis, prognosis, and longitudinal
              monitoring in MS. Automating this operation eliminates
              inter-rater variability and increases the efficiency of
              large-throughput analysis pipelines. Robust and reliable
              segmentation across multi-site spinal cord data is challenging
              because of the large variability related to acquisition
              parameters and image artifacts. In particular, a precise
              delineation of lesions is hindered by a broad heterogeneity of
              lesion contrast, size, location, and shape. The goal of this
              study was to develop a fully-automatic framework - robust to
              variability in both image parameters and clinical condition - for
              segmentation of the spinal cord and intramedullary MS lesions
              from conventional MRI data of MS and non-MS cases. Scans of 1042
              subjects (459 healthy controls, 471 MS patients, and 112 with
              other spinal pathologies) were included in this multi-site study
              (n = 30). Data spanned three contrasts (T1-, T2-, and
              T2∗-weighted) for a total of 1943 vol and featured large
              heterogeneity in terms of resolution, orientation, coverage, and
              clinical conditions. The proposed cord and lesion automatic
              segmentation approach is based on a sequence of two Convolutional
              Neural Networks (CNNs). To deal with the very small proportion of
              spinal cord and/or lesion voxels compared to the rest of the
              volume, a first CNN with 2D dilated convolutions detects the
              spinal cord centerline, followed by a second CNN with 3D
              convolutions that segments the spinal cord and/or lesions. CNNs
              were trained independently with the Dice loss. When compared
              against manual segmentation, our CNN-based approach showed a
              median Dice of 95\% vs. 88\% for PropSeg (p $\leq$ 0.05), a
              state-of-the-art spinal cord segmentation method. Regarding
              lesion segmentation on MS data, our framework provided a Dice of
              60\%, a relative volume difference of -15\%, and a lesion-wise
              detection sensitivity and precision of 83\% and 77\%,
              respectively. In this study, we introduce a robust method to
              segment the spinal cord and intramedullary MS lesions on a
              variety of MRI contrasts. The proposed framework is open-source
              and readily available in the Spinal Cord Toolbox.",

              deployed a vendor-neutral 3D spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR)
              sequence on three clinical scanners by two MRI vendors. We then
              acquired T1 maps on the ISMRM-NIST system phantom, as well as T1,
              MTR, and MTsat maps in three healthy participants. We performed
              hierarchical shift function analysis in vivo to characterize the
              differences between scanners when the vendor-neutral sequence is
              used instead of commercial vendor implementations. Inter-vendor
              deviations were compared for statistical significance to test the
              hypothesis. RESULTS: In the phantom, the vendor-neutral sequence
              reduced inter-vendor differences from 8\% to 19.4\% to 0.2\% to
              5\% with an overall accuracy improvement, reducing ground truth
              T1 deviations from 7\% to 11\% to 0.2\% to 4\%. In vivo, we found
              that the variability between vendors is significantly reduced (p

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques allow assessing
              cerebral tissue properties. However, previous studies on the
              accuracy of quantitative T1 and T2 mapping reported a scanner
              model bias of up to 10\% for T1 and up to 23\% for T2. Such
              differences would render multi-centre qMRI studies difficult and
              raise fundamental questions about the general precision of qMRI.
              A problem in previous studies was that different methods were
              used for qMRI parameter mapping or for measuring the transmitted
              radio frequency field B1 which is critical for qMRI techniques
              requiring corrections for B1 non-uniformities. AIMS: The goal was
              to assess the intra- and inter-scanner reproducibility of qMRI
              data at 3 ​T, using two different scanner models from the same
              vendor with exactly the same multiparametric acquisition
              protocol. METHODS: Proton density (PD), T1, T2* and T2 mapping
              was performed on healthy subjects and on a phantom, performing
              each measurement twice for each of two scanner models. Although
              the scanners had different hardware and software versions,
              identical imaging sequences were used for PD, T1 and T2* mapping,
              adapting the codes of an existing protocol on the older system
              line by line to match the software version of the newer scanner.
              For T2-mapping, the respective manufacturer's sequence was used
              which depended on the software version. However, system-dependent
              corrections were carried out in this case. Reproducibility was
              assessed by average values in regions of interest. RESULTS: Mean
              scan-rescan variations were not exceeding 2.14\%, with average
              values of 1.23\% and 1.56\% for the new and old system,
              respectively. Inter-scanner model deviations were not exceeding
              5.21\% with average values of about 2.2-3.8\% for PD, 2.5-3.0\%
              for T2*, 1.6-3.1\% for T1 and 3.3-5.2\% for T2. CONCLUSIONS:
              Provided that identical acquisition sequences are used,
              discrepancies between qMRI data acquired with different scanner
              models are low. The level of systematic differences reported in
              this work may help to interpret multi-centre data.",

              scanner changes, they could play an important role in disease
              diagnosis, prognosis, management, and treatment monitoring. The
              precision of selected QIBs was assessed from data collected on a

              Inevitable scanner changes and acquisition protocol revisions
              occurred during this time. Standard and custom processing
              pipelines were used to calculate regional brain volume, cortical
              thickness, T2, T2*, quantitative susceptibility, cerebral blood
              flow, axial, radial and mean diffusivity, peak width of
              skeletonized mean diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy from the
              acquired images. Coefficient of variation (CoV) and intra-class
              correlation (ICC) indices were determined in the short-term
              (i.e., repeatable over three acquisitions within 4 weeks) and in
              the long-term (i.e., reproducible over four acquisition sessions
              in 5 years). Precision indices varied based on acquisition
              technique, processing pipeline, and anatomical region. Good
              repeatability (average CoV=2.40\% and ICC=0.78) and
              reproducibility (average CoV=8.86 \% and ICC=0.72) were found
              over all QIBs. The best performance indices were obtained for
              diffusion derived biomarkers (CoV∼0.96\% and ICCs=0.87);
              conversely, the poorest indices were found for the cerebral blood

              that changes in protocol, along with hardware and software
              upgrades, did not affect the estimates of the selected biomarkers
              and their precision. Further characterization of the QIB is
              necessary to understand meaningful changes in the biomarkers in

              cord have been recently introduced, none of them cover the entire
              spinal cord. In this study, we introduced an unbiased multimodal
              MRI template of the spinal cord and the brainstem, called PAM50,
              which is anatomically compatible with the ICBM152 brain template
              and uses the same coordinate system. The PAM50 template is based
              on 50 healthy subjects, covers the full spinal cord (C1 to L2
              vertebral levels) and the brainstem, is available for T1-, T2-and
              T2*-weighted MRI contrasts and includes a probabilistic atlas of
              the gray matter and white matter tracts. Template creation
              accuracy was assessed by computing the mean and maximum distance
              error between each individual spinal cord centerline and the
              PAM50 centerline, after registration to the template. Results
              showed high accuracy for both T1- (mean = 0.37 $\pm$ 0.06 mm; max

               approach which utilizes flexibly reusable modules. METHODS: The
               proposed sequence description contains a sequence module
               hierarchy for loop and group logic, which is enhanced by a novel
               strategy for performing efficient parameter and pulse shape
               calculation. These calculations are powered by a flow graph
               structure. By using the flow graph, all calculations are
               performed with no redundancy and without requiring
               preprocessing. The generation of this interpretable structure is
               a separate step that combines MRI techniques while actively
               considering their context. The driver interface is slim and
               highly flexible through scripting support. The sequences do not
               require any vendor-specific compiling or processing step. A
               vendor-independent frontend for sequence configuration can be
               used. Tests that ensure physical feasibility of the sequence are
               integrated into the calculation logic. RESULTS: The framework
               was used to define a set of standard sequences. Resulting images
               were compared to respective images acquired with sequences
               provided by the device manufacturer. Images were acquired using
               a standard commercial MRI system. CONCLUSIONS: The approach
               produces configurable, vendor-independent sequences, whose
               configurability enables rapid prototyping. The transparent data

  abstract = "The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
              statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
              because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise
              constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a
              histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no
              spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM
              model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of
              noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to
              artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field
              distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
              produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel
              hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic
              process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be
              observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through
              observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model
              is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the
              HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information
              is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites.
              Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation
              by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using
              MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the
              HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by
              incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a
              HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be
              achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be
              combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the
              bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997)
              can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a
              three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image

              distribution in the brain such as streamline count (density),
              average length and spatial extent (volume) are biased by
              erroneous streamlines produced by tractography algorithms. In
              this paper, solutions are proposed to reduce biases in the
              streamline distribution. First, we propose to optimize
              tractography parameters in terms of connectivity. Then, we
              propose to relax the tractography stopping criterion with a novel
              probabilistic stopping criterion and a particle filtering method,
              both based on tissue partial volume estimation maps calculated
              from a T1-weighted image. We show that optimizing tractography
              parameters, stopping and seeding strategies can reduce the biases
              in position, shape, size and length of the streamline
              distribution. These tractography biases are quantitatively
              reported using in-vivo and synthetic data. This is a critical
              step towards producing tractography results for quantitative
              structural connectivity analysis.",

              cerebral blood flow, vascular reactivity and neurovascular
              coupling. We studied BOLD fMRI activation and cerebrovascular
              reactivity in moyamoya disease. To characterize the impact of
              remote vascular demands on BOLD fMRI measurements, we varied the
              vascular territories engaged by manipulating the experimental
              task performed by the participants. Vascular territories affected
              by disease were identified using BOLD cerebrovascular reactivity.
              Preliminary evidence from two patients pre- and
              postrevascularization surgery and four controls indicates that
              neurovascular coupling in affected brain regions can be modulated
              by the task-related vascular demands in unaffected regions. In

              MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain
              white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data
              to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber
              bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different
              parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many
              different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal
              pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in
              individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track
              post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide
              transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI
              analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have
              implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as
              the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography.
              In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are
              implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and
              diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as
              methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for

              provided to calculate various statistics, informative

              the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many
              other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed

              encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through
              GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list.
              Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of

              ``traveling heads'' - were imaged at ten different 7 T sites with
              a harmonized quantitative brain MR imaging protocol. In
              conjunction with the system calibration, MP2RAGE, QSM, CEST and
              multi-parametric mapping/relaxometry were examined. RESULTS:
              Quantitative measurements with MP2RAGE showed very high
              reproducibility across sites and subjects, and errors were in
              concordance with previous results and other field strengths. QSM
              had high inter-site reproducibility for relevant subcortical
              volumes. CEST imaging revealed systematic differences between the
              sites, but reproducibility was comparable to results in the
              literature. Relaxometry had also very high agreement between
              sites, but due to the high sensitivity, differences caused by
              different applications of the B1 calibration of the two RF coil
              types used were observed. CONCLUSION: Our results show that
              quantitative brain imaging can be performed with high
              reproducibility at 7 T and with similar reliability as found at 3

              points. We therefore implemented a multiparameter mapping (MPM)
              protocol based on vendor's product sequences and demonstrate its
              repeatability and reproducibility for whole-brain coverage.
              Within ~20 min, four MPM metrics (magnetization transfer
              saturation [MT], proton density [PD], longitudinal [R1], and
              effective transverse [R2*] relaxation rates) were measured using
              an optimized 1 mm isotropic resolution protocol on six 3 T MRI
              scanners from two different vendors. The same five healthy
              participants underwent two scanning sessions, on the same
              scanner, at each site. MPM metrics were calculated using the
              hMRI-toolbox. To account for different MT pulses used by each
              vendor, we linearly scaled the MT values to harmonize them across
              vendors. To determine longitudinal repeatability and inter-site
              comparability, the intra-site (i.e., scan-rescan experiment)
              coefficient of variation (CoV), inter-site CoV, and bias across
              sites were estimated. For MT, R1, and PD, the intra- and
              inter-site CoV was between 4 and 10\% across sites and scan time
              points for intracranial gray and white matter. A higher
              intra-site CoV (16\%) was observed in R2* maps. The inter-site
              bias was below 5\% for all parameters. In conclusion, the MPM
              protocol yielded reliable quantitative maps at high resolution
              with a short acquisition time. The high reproducibility of MPM
              metrics across sites and scan time points combined with its
